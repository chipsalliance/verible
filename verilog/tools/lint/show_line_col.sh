# Script to expand error messages to show the line where an error occurred.
# Works as a pipe: reads from stdin, writes to stdout.
#
# Input is assumed to contain one diagnostic per line in the following format:
#   FILE:LINE:COL: ...text...
#
# The referenced files must be valid paths from the point of invocation of this
# script.
#
# This script exists as a short term workaround, but the plan is to integrate
# this functionality directly into diagnostic-emitting tools.
