**Summary**

Brief description of request.
Reference `[style-lint-rule-name]` if this is about an existing rule, or suggest new lint rule name.

**Test cases and examples**

The more examples you provide, the easier it will be for someone to come along and implement it.

```systemverilog
// This example should be diagnosed.
```

```systemverilog
// This variant should NOT be diagnosed (negative test case)
```

**Proposal**

[optional] Suggest approach or include pseudo code for how one might implement the rule.

**Additional context**

List citations to published style guides, or include relevant excerpts.
