**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Include the
`[style-lint-rule-name]` seen in diagnostics and configuration.

**Test case (preferably reduced)**

```systemverilog
// Ran the style linter on this code.
```

Include the filename if it was relevant to the diagnostic.

**Actual vs. expected behavior**

If the diagnostic is a lexer/syntax error, use the **lexer/parser bug template**
instead.

False-positive? False-negative? Crash? Wrong diagnostic location?

What should have happened?

Citations to published style guides would greatly help.
