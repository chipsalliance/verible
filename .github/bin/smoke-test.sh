# Simple smoke test by running all Verible tools over various code-bases
# that can be fetched by git and making sure it does not crash, letting
# out the magic smoke.
#
# We explicitly do _not_ look if the tools fail with some other exit
# code, as we don't care if e.g. there are lint issues in the projects
# at hand, just that Verible is not crashing on input.
#
# Once we are able to parse full of system verilog, we should check
# that verible-verilog-syntax always return 0.
# For now, even  if there are syntax errors reported: as long as it doesn't
# crash Verible, we're good.
