// indices line up and form contiguous range that span two sequences
// that were diff'd (e.g. output of diff::GetTokenDiffs()).
// 'common_context' is the number of lines of common context to pad before and
// after each hunk.  This is used to determine subsequence cut points.
//
// Example:
//   {DELETE, 0, 1}     // delete one line
//   {EQUALS, 1, 100}   // unchanged
//   {INSERT, 99, 100}  // add one line

//
// splits into two hunks:
//   {DELETE, 0, 1}     // delete one line
//   {EQUALS, 1, 3}     // unchanged
//
//   {EQUALS, 98, 100}  // unchanged
//   {INSERT, 99, 100}  // add one line

// This function could be upstreamed to the editscript library because it is
// agnostic to the type being diff-ed.
