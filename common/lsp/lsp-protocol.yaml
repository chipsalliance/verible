# Language Server Protocol [1] types used in this project.
# There is a huge number of them, so let's just add the ones needed
# as we go.
#
# The types defined here are generated into structs with the jcxxgen
# code generator, that generates structs with the necessary boilerplate to
# be seamlessly converted to and from json with the nlohmann/json library.
